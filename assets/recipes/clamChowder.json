I omitted the bacon because we are pescatarian. Used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of the bacon fat and that worked great. I added more potatoes (about 2 lbs) for some reason and I regretted it, the recipe amount would have been perfect. I also added more clams (4 cans total) because I\u2019m a New Englander and love my clams. That worked out well. Lastly, I added chopped fresh parsley at the end. This is a super solid chowder recipe and I will definitely make it again!"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Loretta Gazzara"},"datePublished":"2020-01-02","reviewBody":"Good recipe!
